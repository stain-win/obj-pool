# Demo Application - Complete Overhaul

## ðŸŽ‰ What's New

The demo application has been completely rebuilt from the ground up to showcase all the powerful features of the obj-pool library in an interactive, visually appealing way.

---

## âœ¨ Key Improvements

### 1. **Interactive Controls**
- **Allocate Objects**: Test pool allocation with 1, 10, or 100 objects at a time
- **Release Operations**: Release all or half of allocated objects with one click
- **Pool Management**: Reserve more objects or shrink the pool dynamically
- **Performance Benchmark**: Run real-time performance comparisons between pooled and non-pooled object creation

### 2. **Real-Time Statistics Display**
- Live monitoring of all managed pools
- Visual progress bars showing pool utilization
- Key metrics displayed:
  - Available objects
  - Objects in use
  - Total capacity
  - Maximum size
  - Total allocations/releases

### 3. **Performance Benchmarking**
- Built-in benchmark tool comparing:
  - Pool-based object creation
  - Traditional `new` object creation
- Shows actual performance improvement percentage
- Runs 10,000 iterations for accurate results
- Visual display of timing and performance gains

### 4. **Modern, Responsive Design**
- Beautiful gradient backgrounds
- Card-based layout with hover effects
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Fully responsive (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Toast notifications for user feedback

### 5. **Feature Showcase Section**
Four highlighted feature cards demonstrating:
- âš¡ High Performance (15-20% faster)
- ðŸ“Š Real-time Statistics
- ðŸ”’ Type Safety (100% TypeScript)
- ðŸŽ¯ Smart Growth (automatic sizing)

### 6. **Code Examples Section**
Three comprehensive code examples showing:
- Basic usage patterns
- Statistics monitoring
- Advanced features (max size, shrinking, batch operations)

### 7. **Visual Feedback**
- Toast notifications for all operations
- Real-time counter showing currently allocated objects
- Color-coded buttons for different operation types
- Progress bars with percentage display
- Animated cards and transitions

## ðŸš€ Technical Implementation

### Component Structure
```typescript
class AppElement extends HTMLElement {
  - Pool instances (Dummy, Grumpy, Factory)
  - Allocated objects tracking
  - Real-time stats monitoring (1s intervals)
  - Event handling for all controls
  - Benchmark execution engine
  - Notification system
}
```

### Features Demonstrated

#### 1. **Pool Creation**
```typescript
// With recycler and max size
this.poolDummy = build(Dummy, 20, (dummy) => {
    dummy.reset();
    return dummy;
}, 100);
```

#### 2. **Factory Pools**
```typescript
this.poolDummyFactory = buildFactory(
    () => new Dummy('Factory Dummy'),
    5,
    (d) => d.reset(),
    50
);
```

#### 3. **Statistics Monitoring**
```typescript
const allStats = getAllPoolStats();
// Real-time updates every second
```

#### 4. **Batch Operations**
```typescript
// Release multiple objects at once
pool.release([obj1, obj2, obj3]);
```

#### 5. **Pool Management**
```typescript
pool.reserve(50);  // Pre-allocate
pool.shrink(10);   // Reduce size
```
